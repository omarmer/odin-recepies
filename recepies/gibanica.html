    <h3>
      Gibanica, a traditional Serbian pastry, is a beloved culinary treasure
      renowned for its rich, savory layers and comforting taste. This
      multi-layered pie, often a centerpiece at celebrations, seamlessly blends
      the crispiness of phyllo dough with the creamy depth of cheese, creating a
      harmonious fusion of textures and flavors.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The recipe for Gibanica begins with thin sheets of phyllo dough, which are
      lightly brushed with oil or melted butter to achieve a golden, flaky crust
      upon baking. The filling, a hearty mixture of eggs and cheese, typically
      combines crumbled feta for its tangy bite and smooth cottage cheese for a
      creamy consistency. Some variations also include spinach or minced meat,
      catering to diverse palates. The filling is generously spread between the
      phyllo layers, often with a sprinkle of aromatic herbs like dill or
      parsley for an added burst of flavor. Once assembled, the pie is baked to
      perfection, resulting in a golden-brown exterior that encases a moist,
      rich interior. This delightful dish is not only a staple at Serbian
      gatherings but has also gained popularity in neighboring Balkan countries,
      celebrated for its comforting taste and the joy it brings to family
      tables.
